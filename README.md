<!-- 
> 💡 Since this project relies on environment variables (e.g. `SECRET_KEY`, `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`, etc.), the full Docker setup is **not necessary for recruiters to replicate** — it’s already live and running.  
> If you’re an engineer interested in setup details, see the `Dockerfile` for reference.
